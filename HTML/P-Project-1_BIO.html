                        <p id="cnt-childhood"><blockqoute>My name is Railey Dion G. Cabildo, and I am about to share the story of my childhood years.<sup>1</sup>
                        To begin with, I was born in Meycauayan, Bulacan, to my parents, Krisma and Rodrigo Cabildo.<sup>2</sup> My nickname is "Abu" and I am 18 yearsold.<sup>3</sup> March is my birthmonth and my birthyear is <u><em>2004</em></u>.<sup>4</sup> 
                        My favorite childhood place was <u><em>SM Marilao</em></u> with my family because going there was fun and enjoyable.<sup>5</sup>
                        I had a dog named <em>Nuggets</em> whom I loved dearly. Sadly, one day he passed away and went to heaven.<sup>6</sup> It was a difficult time for me, and I felt very sad.<sup>7</sup>
                        Childhood holds a special place in my heart because during those years, there were no worries, and
                        the only concerns revolved around playing outside and enjoying time with friends.<sup>8</sup> My father had a
                        routine of insisting on my afternoon nap, and if I failed to sleep, I wasn't allowed to go outside in the
                        afternoon.<sup>9</sup> During this time, I enjoyed playing computer games such as <em>GTA, Counter-Strike, and
                        Dota</em>.<sup>10</sup> Playing is outside is my only activity this time.<sup>11</sup> During those years, I always enjoyed eating a
                        lot, leading to an increase in my body weight.<sup>12</sup> In my childhood years, I could sleep for 8 hours or more,
                        but now, it's challenging for me to achieve the same duration of sleep.<sup>13</sup> In the past, I could accomplish
                        many things effortlessly, but as I've grown older, it has become challenging or even impossible due
                        to the increasing responsibilities that come with age.<sup>14</sup> If I had a power to go back on this days, I would
                        go back and make more memories in this time, because that time was devoid of stress and problems,
                        just a time of pure heart and mind.<sup>15</sup> I yearn to return to that simplicity and joy.<sup>16</sup> Simply put, my childhood
                        was a mix of simple <em>pleasures, happiness, and learning, influenced by the balance of family, play,
                        and self-discovery</em>.<sup>17</sup> Looking back, I realize that my childhood taught me the importance of having fun, because if you grow old the time that you will get fun become less.<sup>18</sup>
                        These early experiences still echo in me, reminding me of the carefree days that
                        have shaped who I am today.<sup>19</sup> Those cherished memories continue to serve as a guiding light, inspiring
                        me to embrace life with the same sense of wonder and joy that defined my childhood.<sup>20</sup></blockqoute><p>

                <p id="cnt-teenage">Heading into my teenage years, as I grow older, I encounter many challenges and problems that
                contribute to my strength and overall growth.<sup>1</sup> As a teenager, you will learn a lot especially when facing failures.<sup>2</sup>
                Teenage years taught me the importance of <strong><em>setting goals</em></strong> early to gain a clearer understanding of my future.<sup>3</sup>
                I'd like to share an experience that changed my perspective during my teenage years.<sup>4</sup> In <i>2018</i>, before the
                pandemic, I was managing some Facebook pages that I have.<sup>5</sup> I initially created <em>Facebook pages</em> for fun,
                but everything changed when they gained popularity, reaching <em>500k likes</em>.<sup>6</sup> The influx of people engaging on
                my pages led to business opportunities.<sup>7</sup> Individuals approached me, offering money to share their content on
                my Facebook page.<sup>8</sup> As a teenager, I recognized that I could earn my own money at a young age.<sup>9</sup> I decided to
                focus on this work, allowing me to purchase the things I desired without relying on the <em>money of my parents</em>.<sup>10</sup>
                This journey taught me how important it is to stay strong, set goals, and take control of my own path.<sup>11</sup>
                As of today, I am managing several <u>Facebook pages</u> and <em>earning</em>a decent income.<sup>12</sup> This has proven to be a
                significant help for me, especially with numerous expenses that arise.<sup>13</sup>
                Moving forward, I keep these lessons and a sense of adventure, ready to handle anything that comes my way.<sup>14</sup> Additionally, I prefer not to ask for money
                from my parents because they taught me to be independent.<sup>15</sup>
                Going from handling <em>social media</em> to making my own money, my journey taught me to be resourceful and always eager to <em>grow</em>.<sup>16</sup> Navigating through my teenage years, I've learned
                from challenges and pursued passions.<sup>17</sup> This journey taught resilience and determination.<sup>18</sup> Excited for more
                opportunities, I'll cultivate independence and ready to embrace the adventures that lie ahead.<sup>19</sup>
                That's the end of my teenage story. Now, let's talk about my time in college.<sup>20</sup></p>

                <p id="cnt-college">Moving on to the present, I, Railey Dion Cabildo, am currently a 2nd-year college student at
                the <strong><em>University of the East Manila</em></strong>, pursuing the course of <u>Information Technology</u> or IT.<sup>1</sup> I just want to
                share my experiences in the past few years that I am studying in the University of the East.<sup>2</sup> In my first
                year as a college student, I faced numerous challenges, including difficulties in communication and
                socializing with others.<sup>3</sup> The pandemic years took a toll on my confidence as I couldn't exercise and
                ended up gaining weight due to increased eating.<sup>4</sup> During the first semester of my first year, I had
                <em>online classes</em>.<sup>5</sup> Despite the virtual nature of the classes, the insecurities related to being overweight
                persisted.<sup>6</sup> So, I challenged myself to incorporate <em>workouts</em> into my routine and shed some weight in
                preparation for the upcoming face-to-face classes in the second semester.<sup>7</sup> On the first day of the
                second semester, I felt extremely nervous as I had only a few friends in my section, and my shy nature
                made it challenging to socialize with others.<sup>8</sup> However, as time went on, I managed to overcome my
                initial hesitation, and now, I have many friends in my section.<sup>9</sup> Moving on to the next year, I am now a
                <strong><em>second-year</em></strong> college student dealing with increasing academic challenges and stress.<sup>10</sup> Nevertheless,
                I continue to persevere because overcoming obstacles is an integral part of being a student.<sup>11</sup> At the
                beginning of the second semester of my second year, I want to share a memorable experience.<sup>12</sup> The
                Student Council announced a sportsfest at the University of the East Manila. The CCSS council
                organized tryouts, and by the grace of God, I successfully passed and got the opportunity to play
                basketball, representing the College of <strong><em>Computer Studies and Systems (CCSS)</em></strong> in the sportsfest.<sup>13</sup> This
                moment significantly boosted my confidence, and I am grateful for the <u>sportsfest</u> as it allowed me to
                make more new friends.<sup>14</sup> We lose 2 games but we give out best and I appreciate my teammates efforts.<sup>15</sup> I really enjoyed the time that I play with my teammates and so many things that I learned in that moments.<sup>16</sup> As time passes, I find myself increasingly focused on my studies.<sup>17</sup> Currently,
                our attention is intensifying as the <em>Capstone project</em> approaches.<sup>18</sup> This phase is considered one of the
                most challenging aspects of college, and we are fully dedicated to meeting its demands.<sup>19</sup> As I navigate
                through the remaining years of my college journey, I am determined to face any challenges that come
                my way, armed with the lessons and experiences that have shaped me thus far.<sup>20</sup><br>
